# Exercise 6

In this lab we will show how to deploy one or more models (like the output from HPO) into an endpoint without retraining

- On the notebook instance, start it and Open Jupyter Lab
- Load the `deploy_multiple_models_one_endpoint` notebook from the `exercise` folder
- Solve it!
- Now configure auto scaling on that endpoint!  
- When done, please stop the notebook instance
